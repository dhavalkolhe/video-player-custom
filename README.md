## Structure in brief

The project follows a modular structure with React components like `App`, `Player`, and `Playlist`, each handling specific functionalities and user interactions. `App` manages overall state, including video data, while `Player` focuses on video playback controls and interaction. `Playlist` displays a list of videos and allows reordering via `react-drag-reorder`. External libraries like `@phosphor-icons/react` and `react-drag-reorder` are utilized. Additionally, a custom hook `usePlayer` provides various video control functions. Styling is applied using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness. The project maintains clear separation of concerns and extensibility, facilitating easy maintenance and further development.
